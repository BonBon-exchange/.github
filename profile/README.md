# BonBon.exchange

"If it exists, there is data about it."

## The Exchange - buy and sell data

Like any regular exchange, trade making Bids and Asks. But on this exchange, you are bidding for data with granular properties. Do you want browsing histories, browsing themes, retentions, returning frequencies, usages time or other tabs/windows url? Do you want to obtain data from all users, a specific city, women, or the 90s generation?
Everything is possible, except fingerprinting and nominative bids.

_A practical example:_
_A company wants to understand the needs and habits of Github users, in order to propose a tailored service to this market audience._
- Bid: CHF 5.- per unit | other tabs (urls) opened when visiting github.com | 1000 units (users) maximum over 30 days of usage | living in Europe
- Ask: CHF 5.- | urls visited and urls association (tabs opened at the same time) those last 30 days | living in Europe



_Another example:_
_A startup proposes a new online service. A potential competitor wants to replicate the service, but also wants to ensure that the user retention is good enough to justify the investment._
- Bid: CHF 5.- per unit | if you visited startupweb.com, did you come back to the website and when | 1000 units (users) maximum over 30 days of usage | living anywhere
- Ask: CHF 5.- | visited startupweb.com, visited a second time or not | living in US
