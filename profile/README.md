# BonBon Exchange

"If it exists, there is data about it."

## Data exchange

Like any regular exchange, trade making Bids and Asks. But on this exchange, you are bidding for data with granular properties. Do you want browsing histories, browsing themes, retention, returning frequency, usage time or other tabs/windows url?

Everything is possible, except fingerprinting and nominative bids.
